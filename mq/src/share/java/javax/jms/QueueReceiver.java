/** A client uses a <CODE>QueueReceiver</CODE> object to receive messages that 
  * have been delivered to a queue.
  *
  * <P>Although it is possible to have multiple <CODE>QueueReceiver</CODE>s 
  * for the same queue, the JMS API does not define how messages are 
  * distributed between the <CODE>QueueReceiver</CODE>s.
  *
  * <P>If a <CODE>QueueReceiver</CODE> specifies a message selector, the 
  * messages that are not selected remain on the queue. By definition, a message
  * selector allows a <CODE>QueueReceiver</CODE> to skip messages. This 
  * means that when the skipped messages are eventually read, the total ordering
  * of the reads does not retain the partial order defined by each message 
  * producer. Only <CODE>QueueReceiver</CODE>s without a message selector
  * will read messages in message producer order.
  *
  * <P>Creating a <CODE>MessageConsumer</CODE> provides the same features as
  * creating a <CODE>QueueReceiver</CODE>. A <CODE>MessageConsumer</CODE> object is 
  * recommended for creating new code. The  <CODE>QueueReceiver</CODE> is
  * provided to support existing code.
