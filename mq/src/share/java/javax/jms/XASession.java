/** The <CODE>XASession</CODE> interface extends the capability of 
  * <CODE>Session</CODE> by adding access to a JMS provider's support for the
  * Java Transaction API (JTA) (optional). This support takes the form of a 
  * <CODE>javax.transaction.xa.XAResource</CODE> object. The functionality of 
  * this object closely resembles that defined by the standard X/Open XA 
  * Resource interface.
  *
  * <P>An application server controls the transactional assignment of an 
  * <CODE>XASession</CODE> by obtaining its <CODE>XAResource</CODE>. It uses 
  * the <CODE>XAResource</CODE> to assign the session to a transaction, prepare 
  * and commit work on the transaction, and so on.
  *
  * <P>An <CODE>XAResource</CODE> provides some fairly sophisticated facilities 
  * for interleaving work on multiple transactions, recovering a list of 
  * transactions in progress, and so on. A JTA aware JMS provider must fully 
  * implement this functionality. This could be done by using the services 
  * of a database that supports XA, or a JMS provider may choose to implement 
  * this functionality from scratch.
  *
  * <P>A client of the application server is given what it thinks is a 
  * regular JMS <CODE>Session</CODE>. Behind the scenes, the application server 
  * controls the transaction management of the underlying 
  * <CODE>XASession</CODE>.
  *
  * <P>The <CODE>XASession</CODE> interface is optional.  JMS providers 
  * are not required to support this interface. This interface is for 
  * use by JMS providers to support transactional environments. 
  * Client programs are strongly encouraged to use the transactional support
  * available in their environment, rather than use these XA
  * interfaces directly.
