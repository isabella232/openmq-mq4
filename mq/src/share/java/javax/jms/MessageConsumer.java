  * from a destination.  A <CODE>MessageConsumer</CODE> object is created by 
  * passing a <CODE>Destination</CODE> object to a message-consumer creation
  * method supplied by a session.
  *
  * <P><CODE>MessageConsumer</CODE> is the parent interface for all message 
  * consumers.
  *
  * <P>A message consumer can be created with a message selector. A message
  * selector allows 
  * the client to restrict the messages delivered to the message consumer to 
  * those that match the selector.
  *
  * <P>A client may either synchronously receive a message consumer's messages 
  * or have the consumer asynchronously deliver them as they arrive.
  *
  * <P>For synchronous receipt, a client can request the next message from a 
  * message consumer using one of its <CODE>receive</CODE> methods. There are 
  * several variations of <CODE>receive</CODE> that allow a 
  * client to poll or wait for the next message.
  *
  * <P>For asynchronous delivery, a client can register a 
  * <CODE>MessageListener</CODE> object with a message consumer. 
  * As messages arrive at the message consumer, it delivers them by calling the 
  * <CODE>MessageListener</CODE>'s <CODE>onMessage</CODE> method.
  *
  * <P>It is a client programming error for a <CODE>MessageListener</CODE> to 
  * throw an exception.
