/** A client uses a <CODE>TopicPublisher</CODE> object to publish messages on a 
  * topic. A <CODE>TopicPublisher</CODE> object is the publish-subscribe form
  * of a message producer.
  *
  * <P>Normally, the <CODE>Topic</CODE> is specified when a 
  * <CODE>TopicPublisher</CODE> is created.  In this case, an attempt to use 
  * the <CODE>publish</CODE> methods for an unidentified 
  * <CODE>TopicPublisher</CODE> will throw a 
  * <CODE>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</CODE>.
  *
  * <P>If the <CODE>TopicPublisher</CODE> is created with an unidentified 
  * <CODE>Topic</CODE>, an attempt to use the <CODE>publish</CODE> methods that 
  * assume that the <CODE>Topic</CODE> has been identified will throw a 
  * <CODE>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</CODE>.
  *
  * <P>During the execution of its <CODE>publish</CODE> method,
  * a message must not be changed by other threads within the client. 
  * If the message is modified, the result of the <CODE>publish</CODE> is 
  * undefined.
  * 
  * <P>After publishing a message, a client may retain and modify it
  * without affecting the message that has been published. The same message
  * object may be published multiple times.
  * 
  * <P>The following message headers are set as part of publishing a 
  * message: <code>JMSDestination</code>, <code>JMSDeliveryMode</code>, 
  * <code>JMSExpiration</code>, <code>JMSPriority</code>, 
  * <code>JMSMessageID</code> and <code>JMSTimeStamp</code>.
  * When the message is published, the values of these headers are ignored. 
  * After completion of the <CODE>publish</CODE>, the headers hold the values 
  * specified by the method publishing the message. It is possible for the 
  * <CODE>publish</CODE> method not to set <code>JMSMessageID</code> and 
  * <code>JMSTimeStamp</code> if the 
  * setting of these headers is explicitly disabled by the 
  * <code>MessageProducer.setDisableMessageID</code> or
  * <code>MessageProducer.setDisableMessageTimestamp</code> method.
  *
  *<P>Creating a <CODE>MessageProducer</CODE> provides the same features as
  * creating a <CODE>TopicPublisher</CODE>. A <CODE>MessageProducer</CODE> object is 
  * recommended when creating new code. The  <CODE>TopicPublisher</CODE> is
  * provided to support existing code.

  *
  *<P>Because <CODE>TopicPublisher</CODE> inherits from 
  * <CODE>MessageProducer</CODE>, it inherits the
  * <CODE>send</CODE> methods that are a part of the <CODE>MessageProducer</CODE> 
  * interface. Using the <CODE>send</CODE> methods will have the same
  * effect as using the
  * <CODE>publish</CODE> methods: they are functionally the same.
  *
