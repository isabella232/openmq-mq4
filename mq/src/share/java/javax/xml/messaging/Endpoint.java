package javax.xml.messaging;

/**
 * An opaque representation of an application endpoint. Typically, an
 * <code>Endpoint</code> object represents a business entity, but it
 * may represent a party of any sort. Conceptually, an 
 * <code>Endpoint</code> object is the mapping of a logical name
 * (example, a URI) to a physical location, such as a URL.
 * <P>
 * For messaging using a provider that supports profiles, an application
 * does not need to specify an endpoint when it sends a message because 
 * destination information will be contained in the profile-specific header.
 * However, for point-to-point plain SOAP messaging, an application must supply
 * an <code>Endpoint</code> object to
 * the <code>SOAPConnection</code> method <code>call</code>
 * to indicate the intended destination for the message. 
 * The subclass {@link URLEndpoint} can be used when an application
 * wants to send a message directly to a remote party without using a
 * messaging provider.
 * <P>
 * The default identification for an <code>Endpoint</code> object
 * is a URI. This defines what JAXM messaging
 * providers need to support at minimum for identification of
 * destinations. A messaging provider
 * needs to be configured using a deployment-specific mechanism with
 * mappings from an endpoint to the physical details of that endpoint. 
 * <P>
 * <code>Endpoint</code> objects can be created using the constructor, or
 * they can be looked up in a naming
 * service. The latter is more flexible because logical identifiers
 * or even other naming schemes (such as DUNS numbers)
 * can be bound and rebound to specific URIs.
