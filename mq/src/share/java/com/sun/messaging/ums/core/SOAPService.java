/**
 * MQ SOAP Service interface.  This is part of the MQ SOAP Service frame work
 * that is used to implement and provide a new SOAP service in the frame work.
 *
 * <p>A SOAP service consists of the following components:
 *
 * <p>1. Request Handler Chain.  The Request handler can be registered as follows
 * in the web.xml:
 *
 * <p>mq.soap.request.handler.#=MessageHandler class full name.
 *
 * <p>For example,
 *
 * <p>mq.soap.request.handler.1=com.sun.TestMessageListener1
 * <p>mq.soap.request.handler.2=com.sun.TestMessageListener2
 *
 * <P>2. Response Handler Chain.  The Response handler can be registered as
 * follows in the web.xml:
 *
 * <p>mq.soap.response.handler.#=MessageHandler class full name.
 *
 * <p>For example,
 *
 * <P>mq.soap.response.handler.1=com.sun.TestMessageListener1
 * <p>mq.soap.response.handler.2=com.sun.TestMessageListener2
 *
 * <p>3. ReqRespListener onMessage() implementation.
 *
 * <p>4. Service lifecycle management methods.  There are four methods defined
 * for life cycle management - init/start/stop/close.  They are used for
 * init/start/stop/close a MQ SOAP Service instance.  Sub class SHOULD
 * implement or over ride the life cycle methods if necessary.
 *
 *
 * <p>MQSOAPService is a class that provides base implementation of SOApService
 * interface.  A new SOAP service is recommended to sub class MQSOAPService
 * and over ride appropriate methods as needed.  Please see MQSOAPService
 * Javadoc for details.
