/**
 * The MessageHandler is part of the MQ SOAP Messaging Service framework.
 *
 * <p>A MessageHandler is a component to process SOAP messages.  For example,
 * a handler could be designed to process a specific set of SOAP headers.
 *
 * <p>More than one MessageHandler can be formed in a MessageHandler chain.
 *
 * <p>The difference between this interface to JAXM OnewayListener is that
 * the method processMessage() throws SOAPException.  This is required
 * because the implementation is part of the MQ SOAP message processing
 * model, and SOAPException is likely to be generated during the header
 * processing phase.
 *
 * <p>After MQ framework finished processing one MessageHandler, the message is
 * forwarded to the next MessageHandler.
